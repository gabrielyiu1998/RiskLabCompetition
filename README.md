# RiskLabCompetition

The following <a href="https://github.com/gabrielyiu1998/RiskLabCompetition/blob/main/Final_presentation.pdf">presentation</a> is the deck we presented
for our Case Competition. We were tasked with analyzing market risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk for 20 companies. We needed to construct an
ETF portfolio using the 20 stocks that was not overly exposed to the risks above. The <a href="https://github.com/gabrielyiu1998/RiskLabCompetition">R code</a>
uploaded helped us with our stepwise regressions, VaR, and ES calculations.

This project was done in collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/EdJWang">Edward Wang</a> and
